# Deploy Student Starter+ to Vercel

## Why Vercel?

Vercel is perfect for React applications and offers:
- **Lightning-fast deployments** (usually under 30 seconds)
- **Automatic deployments** on every git push
- **Global Edge Network** for optimal performance
- **Preview deployments** for every pull request
- **Zero configuration** for most React/Vite apps
- **Excellent developer experience**

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub (if not already done)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

**Option A: Using Vercel CLI (Fastest)**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from your project directory
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Link to existing project? No
# - What's your project's name? student-starter-plus
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
# - Want to override the settings? No
```

**Option B: Using Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel auto-detects it's a Vite project
5. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Add Environment Variables

In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
3. Add these variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key

### 4. Redeploy (if you added env vars after first deploy)
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Your Project is Already Vercel-Ready!

I can see you have a `vercel.json` file that's perfectly configured:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "regions": ["all"]
}
```

This configuration:
- ‚úÖ Handles client-side routing (SPA)
- ‚úÖ Sets correct build command
- ‚úÖ Specifies output directory
- ‚úÖ Optimizes for global deployment

## Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí API
4. Copy:
   - **Project URL** ‚Üí Use as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **Anon public key** ‚Üí Use as `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- Your site will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- Automatic deployments on every push to main branch
- Preview URLs for pull requests
- Organization count should show 16 (as per your database)

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check that Node.js version is compatible (18+)
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard

**Environment variables not working?**
- Make sure they start with `VITE_`
- Redeploy after adding env vars
- Check they're set in the correct environment (Production)

**404 errors on refresh?**
- The `vercel.json` file handles this automatically
- Ensure the file is in your repository root

## Advanced Features

Once deployed, you can explore:
- **Analytics**: Built-in performance metrics
- **Functions**: Add serverless API endpoints
